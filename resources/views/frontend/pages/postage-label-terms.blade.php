                        Pickle Marketplace provides a platform for users to buy and sell products. As a seller on Pickle
                        Marketplace, you may choose to use our Postage Label service to simplify the shipping process
                        for your items. By using our Postage Label service, you agree to the following terms and
                        conditions:

                    <p class="about-p">
                        1. Availability: The Postage Label service is available to all sellers on Pickle Marketplace and
                        may not be available in all locations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-p">
                        2. Fees: The fees for the Postage Label service will be displayed at the time of purchase and
                        will be automatically deducted from your account. The fees for the Postage Label service will
                        cover the cost of shipping and handling and may vary based on the size and weight of the item
                        and the shipping destination.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-p">
                        3. Shipping Requirements: The item must be properly packaged and ready to ship according to the
                        shipping carrier's guidelines. The seller is responsible for ensuring that the item is properly
                        packaged and meets the shipping carrier's requirements. If the item is not properly packaged or
                        does not meet the shipping carrier's requirements, Pickle Marketplace may cancel the Postage
                        Label and the seller may be responsible for any additional fees.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-p">
                        4. Delivery: The seller is responsible for ensuring that the item is delivered to the buyer
                        within the agreed-upon timeframe. Pickle Marketplace is not responsible for any delays or lost
                        items during shipping.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-p">
                        5. Refunds: If the buyer requests a return of the item, the seller has the option to purchase a
                        return label for the buyer through the Pickle Marketplace platform. The cost of the return label
                        will be charged to the seller's credit card on file. If the buyer requests a refund for the
                        item, the buyer is responsible for any shipping and handling fees incurred as part of the refund
                        process.
