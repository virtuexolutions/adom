                        At Pickle Marketplace, we strive to provide a safe and secure platform for our users to buy and
                        sell products. However, disputes may arise between buyers and sellers. This Dispute Policy
                        outlines the process for resolving disputes through our platform.

                        1. Reporting Disputes: If a dispute arises between a buyer and a seller, the parties should
                        first attempt to resolve the dispute directly with each other. If the parties are unable to
                        resolve the dispute, the buyer may report the dispute to Pickle Marketplace by contacting us at
                        [insert contact information].
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-p">
                        2. Review and Resolution: Pickle Marketplace will review the dispute and may request additional
                        information from both parties. We will make a good faith effort to assist the parties in
                        resolving the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, Pickle Marketplace may,
                        in its sole discretion, issue a refund to the buyer or take other action to resolve the dispute.
